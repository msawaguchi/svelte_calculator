Just a very common project to learn about a new tech: this is a simple calculator build with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) :star2:

## Get started
Clone the repo...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/msawaguchi/svelte_calculator.git
```

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-calculator
npm install
```

...then start:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. 
Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. 
To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.
